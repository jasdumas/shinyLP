### Additional Comments:
* Error: "Result: NOTE 
    Namespaces in Imports field not imported from:
     ‘shinyBS’ ‘shinythemes’
     All declared Imports should be used. " - RESOLUTION:  made the changes to the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE file to remove the imports that are not required (shinyBS and shinythemes).
* Error: "checking top-level files ... WARNING
Conversion of 'README.md' failed:
pandoc.exe: Could not fetch example1.jpg
example1.jpg: openBinaryFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)" - RESOLUTION: I have properly linked the images for the readme.md to a static url link so the file builds.
